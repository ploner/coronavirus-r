# Visualisation of Coronovirus Case Statistics using R, Shiny and Plotly 

This repository contains the code of a simple R-Shiny web app which downloads and
visualizes the data of the Coronovirus (COVID-19). The **features** of the applications are: 

* Downloads daily case statistics of the Coronoavirus by country.
* Let the user select country, region and metrics to be shown.
* Shows a nice time series plot of the daily and cumulated metrics.

The app code resides in the subdirectory `corona-app-v1`. The easiest way is to clone 
the repository and to open the R-Project by opening the file `corona-app-v1.Rproj`
by means of **RStudio**.
